% ABSTRACT

\begin{abstract}
\noindent We present and compare three models of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia during 2014-2015 and examine the effect of international intervention. We utilize both the Systems Dynamics and Agent-based approaches. We show that the basic reproduction number of the disease is greater than one before intervention and decreases to less than one after intervention, implying eventual irradiation of the disease. We demonstrate that the probability of an outbreak varies depending on the population size and that even for large populations there is a 70\% chance of an outbreak if only one person gets exposed to the disease. In addition, if an outbreak is not contained in early stages and the individuals do not change their behavior as the virus prevails, over 90\% of population contract  the disease and about 75\% of the population dies because of it. Effective intervention may decrease these figures to 4\% of the population  contracting the disease and 2\% dying because of it.\textbf{If spatial dynamics are incorporated Emily and Yuhang  results}
