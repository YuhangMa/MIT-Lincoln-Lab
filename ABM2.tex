The next model we consider is an agent-based model. Each individual in the population can be in one of 7 states discussed above: susceptible, exposed, infected, hospitalized, funeral, recovered or dead. The flow between two states is a  probability of transition from one state to another for a typical individual. We represent our model in Figure~\ref{ABM}. In each time step a typical individual who is susceptible can either transition to an exposed state with probability $p_{SE}$ or stay susceptible with probability $p_{SS}$. An individual in the exposed state transitions to infected with probability $p_{EI}$ and stays exposed with probability $p_{EE}$. An individual who is infected can stay infected, recover, go to a hospital, or die and transition to the funeral state with probabilities $p_{II},\, p_{IR},\, p_{IH}$ and $p_{IF}$, respectively. Recovery is considered a terminal state so individuals in this state stay in it for the remainder of the simulation. Hospitalized individuals may stay hospitalized, transition to recovered or funeral with probabilities $p_{HH}, \, p_{HR}$ and $p_{HF}$. We assume that the individual who dies from Ebola remains infectious through the duration of the entire burial ceremony and no precautions are taken against disease transmission. Safely buried individuals are considered noninfectious and remain in this state.

We let $N$ be the total number of individuals in a population, $N_{I}$  be the total number of individuals in the infected state, $N_{H}$  be the total number of individuals in the hospitalized state and $N_{F}$ be the total number of individuals in the funeral state. We define and present numeric values of individual's probability of transition for each state in Table~\ref{tab:probabilities}. In calculating the probabilities we used parameters found in Table~\ref{tab:knownParameters} and Table~\ref{tab:calibratedParameters}.

\subsection{Simulation}
We consider a population of size 1000 with 999 individuals starting in a susceptible state and 1 individual in the exposed state. This means that the scale of our probabilistic model is different from the scale of the system-based model so that there is not necessarily a direct correspondence between the results. Numeric probabilities of an individual transitioning from each state are recorded in Table~\ref{tab:probabilities}. We run one hundred Monte Carlo simulations and average the results to estimate an outcome of the disease. We define an outbreak as an event in which 2\% of the population or more contracts the disease. If only one individual is exposed to the disease in a population of 1000, there is about 30\% chance that the outbreak does not happen (27/100 trials). However, once the cumulative proportion of the exposed individuals reaches 1\%, the virus affects more than 90\% of the population. A histogram for simulation outcomes is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:Hist}.

We note that the simulations reach their stationary state before $t = 300$. We plot the result of 100 simulations in Figure~\ref{fig:Scatter}. In a number of simulations, no outbreak of Ebola is observed. However there are many cases which show catastrophic disease. In the disastrous case, on average, 93\% of people get the disease and 50\% of people die from it.

If there is no outbreak, the infected agent may or may not infect another agent in the population. However, most people remain in the  susceptible state because the infected individual recovers or dies before infecting enough people to cause an outbreak. The proportion of the population that gets Ebola is low, so all seven states stay relatively constant over time. %Illustration of this case is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:NoOutbreak}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

On the other hand, if the infected agent contacts many people while infected (I), hospitalized (H), or in a funeral state (F) before transitioning to state D or R, there is a an outbreak of the disease. A typical outbreak is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:Outbreak}. The proportion of agents who contract the disease grows exponentially until $t = 125$. That is also the time at which the proportion of the population in states I, H, and F is the highest. After that, the population does not have enough susceptible agents to spread the disease causing the proportion of exposed agents to decrease. The proportion of agents in I, H, and F decreases as well. Around $t = 180$ the proportion of the population is states I, H, and F is zero; the proportion of the population in state S does not decrease, i.e. no agents get Ebola. At this point, every agent remains in S, R or D and an equilibrium is reached (stable fixed point). As we showed before, on average, 7\% of agents stay in state S, 43\% of agents stay in R, and 50\% of agents would be in D. %The result of a typical outbreak is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:Outbreak}.

We plot a phase portrait for the proportion of agents who never got infected and are in S versus the proportion of agents who contracted the disease (both D and R) as time progresses. On the horizontal axis, we put the ratio of S to the total population and on the vertical axis - the ratio of D plus R to the total population.  When $t = 0$, one agent is in state E and 99.9\% of agents are in S. All other states contain no agents. About 30\% of the time, there is no outbreak. In such case, only few people get Ebola. As time goes by there are only few transitions between states and a stationary point is reached within a few time steps. However, if there is an outbreak, the trajectory gradually moves to its equilibrium state. On average, the equilibrium occurs at $(S, R+ D) = (0.07, 0.93)$. We conduct one hundred experiments and plot their trajectories on the same graph, presented in Figure~\ref{fig:PhasePortraitAbm}. Because the total proportion of people in the population is one, the equilibria in different experiments lie on the $x + y = 1$ line. The system starts at $(S, R+D) = (0.999, 0)$, a point that is close to this line. During the course of the outbreak, the phase portrait falls below the black line because a portion of the population are in the transient states: E, I, H and F.

As in the system dynamics approach, we perform an intervention in the agent-based model. Because the scale in the two models is different, we implement the intervention step if we see a total of 1\% of agents contracting the disease. At the beginning of intervention, we change the three $\beta$s, representing the different contact rates. Our results, presented in Table~\ref{tab:intervention}, show that if we start the intervention at 1\% of population having Ebola, 4\% of agents get the disease, 2\% of agents recover and 2\% of agents die. This is a significant improvement over the disastrous predicted outcome of an outbreak without an intervention.

We examine the effect of the population size on the outcome of the agent-based model. Besides the baseline case of $N = 1000$, we set the total population to be $N = 100$ and $5000$. The results show that an increase in population size decreases the standard deviation of the quantities S, D and R, but the relative averages remain the same. As the population size increases stochastic variation decreases and the system becomes more predictable.

We also examine the probability of outbreak occurring based on the population size. The results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:OtbreakProb}. As population size increases, the probability of outbreak occurring decreases but never gets below around 70 \%.
